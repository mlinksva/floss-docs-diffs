                    <li>The person who associated a work with this agreement has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.</li>

                <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
                    automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
                    (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
                    and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
                    a database (each, a "Work").</p>
                
                <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
                    to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
                    creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
                    public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
                    infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
                    reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
                    whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
                    commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
                    Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
                    production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
                    gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
                    through the use and efforts of others.</p>
                
                <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
                    without any expectation of additional consideration
                    or compensation, the person associating the Sharing
                    Agreement with a Work (the "Sharer"), to the extent
                    that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related
                    Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply the
                    Sharing Agreement to the Work and publicly distribute
                    the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or
                    her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and
                    the meaning and intended legal effect of the Sharing

                    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
                    Sharer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
                    and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including

                    preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
